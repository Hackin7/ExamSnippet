Draw the full structural formula of compound A.
State one industrial application of reaction 1.
X is one of the two alcohols formed in reaction 2. Draw the structure of the other isomer, Y, in the box below.
The same products are formed when both X and Y are completely combusted. Explain in terms of bond breaking and bond forming, why the enthalpy change of combustion for the two isomers are the same.
Use the information in the table to indicate the final energy level of the two solutions. Label clearly the enthalpy change (delta H) and products of each change.
Using your answer in (a), describe the differences in the energy changes that happen as each compound dissolves.
Draw the displayed formula of the compound formed between tartaric acid and ethanol.
State the number of moles of sodium hydroxide required to neutralise one mole of tartaric acid.
Use the titration results to calculate the concentration of the tartaric acid in the sample.
If the tartaric acid is now replaced by sulfuric acid of the same concentration, would you expect the speed of reaction to be faster or slower? Explain your answer in terms of collision theory.
Fill in the above table 1 with the correct answers
M has a valency of 2. Using the information given and by means of calculations, identify metal M.
Sketch and label on the graph above for the reaction shown in Table 2 below.
If the same number of moles of copper was used instead of M in experiment e, would there be a difference in the volume of hydrogen gas produced?
What is the relationship between the standard reduction potential of these metals and their reactivity?
Draw a labelled diagram to show the set-up of a simple cell involving nickel and metal B, in a beaker of green dilute nickelII) mitrate solution. Your diagram should include a voltmeter and indicate the direction of electron flow in the circuit.
Write the ionic half equations for the reactions that occur at the nickel and metal B electrodes.
Describe and explain how the pH of the electrolyte changes during the experiment.
A piece of metal F is placed in a beaker of dilute nickel(II) nitrate solution. Describe the observations. Explain your answer.
Scientists think that global warming is due to the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. Explain how the graphs support this statement.
"Carbon dioxide and methane may not be the only two greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming." Using the information from the graphs, explain how the information can be used to support the above statement.
The ozone layer decomposed naturally in the presence of ultra-violet light to form oxygen at the upper atmosphere. Write an equation to show the natural decomposition of ozone at the upper atmosphere.
The enthalpy change, delta H, of the decomposition of ozone at the upper atmosphere is -142.3 kJ/mol. Explain why the enthalpy change, delta H, has a "-" sign.
Explain in terms of energy and particle collisions, how a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction.

The same monomers were used to make polymer C and polymer D. Give the structural formula of the monomer.
What conclusion can you draw from your answers to (c) and (d)
State the relationship between the concentration of lithium nitrate solution and the volume of water absorbed by per gram of sodium polyacrylate shown in Table 2.
The passage says data in Table 2 will allow scientists to explore the efficiency of sodium polyacrylate to remove toxic metal ions from the environment. Explain how sodium polyacrylate can remove toxic metal ions.
Suggest a reason why "sodium polyacrylate can absorb 800 times tis weight in distilled water, but only 300 times its weight in tap water".
Explain why zircaloy-4 has great tensile strength
Use the periodic Table to name two elements which have similar chemical properties as zirconium.
Describe the similarities and differences between the bonding and structures in zirconium dioxide and diamond.
Zirconium dioxide is an oxidising agent while diamond is a reducing agent. Explain why the above statement is true.

Predict his results and explain why the results of the test would not help him to identify all the solutions.
Suggest a reason why argon is not included in the table of information about Period 3 oxides.
Describe the trend in atomic radii for Group I and Group VII
Describe the change in the radii when a Group I element forms an ion and when a Group VII element forms an ion
Suggest why the radii change in this way when an ion is formed (i) Group I (ii) Group VII
Use the information in the table to describe and explain the trend in the melting point down Group I
