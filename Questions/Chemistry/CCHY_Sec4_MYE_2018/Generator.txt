Using the information from the table, state two evidences to show that hexadecanoic acid belongs to the carboxylic acids homologous series. 
It is more difficult to estimate the melting point of butanoic acid than its boiling point. Do you agree with this statement? Explain your reasoning. 
One industrial use of ethanoic acid is to remove limescale (calcium carbonate) from steel pipes. Write the equation for the reaction that occurs when ethanoic acid reacts with calcium carbonate
A student carried out two experiments with the following conditions: experiment 1: dilute methanoic acid and sodium carbonate, experiment 2: dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium carbonate. Explain what the student will observe
An acid salt can be formed between the reaction of dilute hexadecanoic acid and aqueous barium hydroxide. Do you agree with the above statement? Explain your answer. 
Arrange the five metals in decreasing order of reactivity
Suggest a possible identity for metal R
A student placed an unknown metal U into dilute hydrochloric acid. He observed there was some fizzing but the reaction stopped suddenly. Suggest what could have hapened. 
Explain the above observations, with the use of relevant equation(s). 
Using the information aboce, state how the order of reactivity of organic halides is similar or different from the order of reactivity of halogens.
Using the idea of oxidation states, explain whether the reaction between aqueous asilver nitrate and organic halides is considered as a redox reaction. 
Using the definition of isomer, explain whether the two compounds above are isomers of each other.
When reacting with propane, gaseous bromine reacts in a similar manner like the reaction of gaseous chlorine with propane. Describe one similarity and one difference between these two reactions. 
Ethanol is a renewable alcohol fuel made from plant material such as sugar cane by fermentation. Construct an equation for the fermentation of glucose. 
Explain why fermentation alone cannot make pure ethanol. 
Some environmentalists claim that ethanol is a ‘carbon-neutral’ fuel. Explain why such claim is made
Based on the information above, explain, in terms of bond breaking and bond making, whether the enthalpy change of complete combustion is endothermic or exothermic. 
Draw an energy profile diagram for the combustion of ethanol. You are to include the labels for the activation energy and enthalpy change clearly. 
Calculate the energy output of 1.00g of each fuel, leaving your final answer in 3 significant figures. 
Calculate the total energy output in kJ when 1.00 kg of the E10 fuel mixture is completely burnt. Leave your final answer in 3 significant figures.
A car will travel a greater distance in kilometers using 1.00kg of E10 fuel mixture than using 1.00kg of ethanol. Do you agree with the above statement? Explain your answer. (Involves calculations from questions before)
Explain what is so unusual about the bonding present in an ozone molecule. 
Write equations to show the formation of stratospheric ozone. 
Write an overall equation for the formation of stratospheric ozone. 
Construct an overall equation for the breakdown of ozone. 
Using 3O2 - >2O3 and 2O3 -> 3O2, explain the following. “The production of stratospheric ozone is balanced by its destruction. ” 
Which student do you agree with? Explain your reasoning. 
Suggest a reason why transport of tropospheric ozone by surface air to the stratosphere is not effective. 
Use the information above to suggest the benefits of recycling aluminium. 
Pure aluminium is rarely used for construction of large objects. Small amount of other metals are usually mixed with aluminium. Use ideas about arrangement of atoms to explain why. 
Aluminium resists corrosion. Explain why the above sentence is incorrect. 
Explain why the oxide layer of aluminium can be removed using sodium hydroxide. 
The heat source is turned off when no more change is observed in the porcelain boat. However, the hydrogen is kept flowing until the tube is cold. Suggest a reason why. 
Describe and explain the changes you would see in the three porcelain boats. 
Compare the bonding and structures of these two compounds. 
Using the information from the table, compare the physical properties of these two compounds. Explain. 
Suggest, with reason, which compound should be chosen as a material to make rope. 
Under suitable conditions, compound B can be broken down to reform its two starting reactants. Draw the displayed formulae of these two starting reactants. 
Describe the similarities and differences between the two pH graphs for titration 1 and titration 2.
Sodium hydroxide is described as a strong alkali but aqueous ammonia is described as a weak alkali. Use the information from the graphs to explain why. 
Oxalic acid is a weak acid. Suggest a reason why titration 3 shows pH 1.5 when no aqueous sodium hydroxide is added
Methyl orange is red in solution below pH 3 and orange in solution above pH 4. Ecplain why methyl orange would not be suitable to use when titrating oxalic acid with dilute sodium hydroxide. 
Oxalic acid can be reduced to form its starting reactant with the use of a reducing agent. Draw the structural formula of the starting reactant. and circle the functional group(s).
