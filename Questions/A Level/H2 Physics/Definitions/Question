What is 
1
Accuracy
Accuracy refers to how closely the measured value agrees with the 'true' value
1
Precision
Precision refers to how closely individual measurements agree with each other without reference to any 'true' value
1
Systematic Error
A systematic error is one that occurs according to some fixed rule or pattern such that they yield a consistent over-estimation or under-estimation of the true value of the measured quantity
1
Random Error
A random error is one that occurs without a fixed pattern such that a set of measurements done under the same conditions have an equally likely chance of being greater or less than the true value
1
a Scalar
A scalar is a quantity which has magnitude only
1
a Vector
A vector is a quantity which has both magnitude and direction
1
Displacement
Displacmement of an object is its distance from a fixed point in a specific direction
1
Average speed
Average speed of a body is defined as total distance travelled over total time taken
1
Velocity
The velocity of a body is defined as the rate of change of displacement
1
Acceleration
The acceleration of a body is defined as the rate of change of velocity
1
Mass
The mass of a body is a measure of its resistance to change in state of motion
1
Momentum
The momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass and its velocity
1
Force
The force exerted by X on Y is defined as the rate of change in the momentum of Y produced by X
1
Impulse
The impulse of a force is defined as the product of the force and the time of impact of the force
1
Newton's First Law of Motion
In the absence of resultant external force acting on it, a body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will continue its motion at constant velocity
1
Newton's Second Law of Motion
The rate of change in the momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant external force that acts on it, and the change in momentum is in the direction of the force
1
Newton's Third Law of Motion
When a body A exerts a force on body B, B exerts a reaction force on A that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the action force
1
Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum
In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of bodies in a system remains constant
1
a collision
An interaction between two or more bodies that is usually short in duration
1
Elastic collision
A collision in which the total kinectic energy after the collision is equal to that before the collision is called a (perfectly) elastic collision
1
Inelastic collision
A collision in which the total kinectic energy after the collision is less than that before the collision
1
Perfectly/Completely inelastic collision
A collision in which the loss in total kinectic energy is so great that the bodies do not seperate, but move together with a constant velocity
1
Superelastic collision
A collision in which the total kinectic energy after a collision is more than that before (like in an explosion)
1
Hooke's Law
Hooke's Law states that extension (or compression) in a material is directly proportional to the applied force, provided that the limit of proportionality is not exceeded
1
Pressure
Pressure is the normal force per unit area
3
Upthrust (Archimedes Principle)
Uptrust is the upward force exerted by a fluid on a submerged or floating object
It arises due to the difference in pressure between the upper and lower surfaces of the object
It is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the fluid displaced by a submerged or floating object
1
Principle of Flotation 
Principle of Flotation states that when an object floats in equilibrium, uptrust is equal to the qweight of the object
1
the Moment of a Force
The moment of a force about a pivot is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force
1
Torque
The torque of a couple is the product of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between the forces
1
Principle of moments
Principle of moments states that for a body in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about any point is equal to the sum of anti-clockwise moments about the same point
2
a body in equilibrium
It is a body where the resultant force acting on the body is zero (in translational equilibrium)
and the resultant torque on the body is zero (in rotational equilibrium)
0
